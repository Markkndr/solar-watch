## 🎯 Overview

Companies with international operations carry foreign-currency risk on every receivable, payable, and cash balance they hold abroad. When exchange rates move, unhedged exposure turns into real P&L losses.

**This platform solves that** by giving treasury teams a single place to:

- 📊 **See** every foreign-currency position across all entities, in real time
- 🛡️ **Hedge** that exposure optimally with forward contracts and data-driven hedge ratios
- 📈 **Track** live FX rates, volatility, and threshold alerts
- 🧮 **Analyze** P&L attribution, scenarios, and risk metrics for executives and auditors

---

## 👥 Who It's For

| Role | What they get |
|------|---------------|
| **Treasury teams** | Real-time exposure inventory and hedging tools |
| **CFOs** | Consolidated risk dashboards and scenario analysis |
| **Finance controllers** | Hedge-accounting compliance and audit-ready reporting |

---

## 🗺 Roadmap

### Phase 1 — 📦 Exposure Tracking
- Real-time inventory of all foreign-currency positions (receivables, payables, cash)
- Breakdowns by currency, subsidiary, customer, and supplier
- Historical exposure trends
- Exposure consolidation across entities
- Multi-currency P&L impact analysis

### Phase 2 — 🛡️ Hedging Management
- Calculate optimal hedge ratios (how much to hedge)
- Forward-contract tracking and management
- Hedge effectiveness testing (accounting compliance)
- Rebalancing recommendations
- Cost-benefit analysis of hedging strategies

### Phase 3 — 📈 FX Rate Management
- Real-time FX rate feeds from multiple providers
- Rate monitoring and threshold alerts
- Spot vs. forward rate analysis
- Rate volatility tracking
- Historical rate charting

### Phase 4 — 🔬 Advanced Analytics & Reporting
- FX P&L attribution (which transactions caused losses)
- Hedge-effectiveness reporting (for auditors)
- Scenario analysis (*what if EUR drops 5%?*)
- Risk metrics (Value at Risk, duration)
- Consolidated exposure dashboards for executives
- Tax reporting for hedging transactions

---

## 🧠 Business Logic Examples

```text
• Consolidate a $500K payable in EUR and a $300K receivable in GBP → net exposure
• Hedge with a forward contract at 1.08 → calculate the locked-in FX rate
• Run scenarios: What happens if EUR/USD moves to 1.05, 1.10, or 1.15?
• Recommend a hedge ratio: should we hedge 50%, 75%, or 100%?
• Flag mismatches: receivable in EUR but costs in USD → natural-hedge opportunity
```

---

## 🏗 Architecture

Key components that make up the platform:

- **FX rate engine** — integrates multiple market-data providers (e.g. Bloomberg, Reuters, OANDA)
- **Position aggregation** — pulls and normalizes positions across multiple source systems
- **Hedge accounting calculations** — IAS 39 / ASC 815 compliance
- **Scenario & sensitivity engine** — stress-tests exposure against rate movements
- **Real-time alerting system** — threshold and volatility triggers
- **Multi-currency consolidation** — entity-level roll-up into a group view

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Planned Technology |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Backend** | Java 21, Spring Boot 4 |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (time-series data) |
| **Caching / live rates** | Redis |
| **Streaming** | Apache Kafka (FX data pipelines) |
| **Frontend** | React with D3 / Recharts |
| **Real-time** | WebSockets for live updates |
| **Auth** | JWT-based authentication (jjwt) |

---

## ✅ Current Status

The foundational backend layer is in place. Implemented so far:

- 🔐 **Authentication & accounts** — register, login, JWT access + refresh tokens, logout, change password, email verification, and profile retrieval
- 👤 **User domain** — user entity with KYC status, daily exchange limits, and 2FA fields
- 👛 **Wallet & transaction model** — multi-currency wallets and a transaction ledger (exchange, deposit, withdrawal, transfer) with fee and exchange-rate tracking
- 🛡️ **Security layer** — Spring Security with a JWT authentication filter and token provider
- 🗄️ **Persistence** — Spring Data JPA repositories over PostgreSQL

The exposure, hedging, rate-feed, and analytics phases described in the [roadmap](#-roadmap) are the next milestones.

> 📝 Note: the current data model began as a wallet/exchange foundation; the entities will evolve toward the treasury-exposure model (positions, hedges, forward contracts) as Phase 1 lands.

### Implemented API — `/api/auth`

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/register` | Create a new account |
| `POST` | `/login` | Authenticate and receive tokens |
| `POST` | `/refresh-token` | Refresh an access token |
| `GET` | `/profile` | Get the current user's profile |
| `POST` | `/change-password` | Change password |
| `GET` | `/verify-email` | Verify email via token |
| `POST` | `/logout` | Log out |
| `GET` | `/health` | Service health check |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21+** and **Maven**
- A running **PostgreSQL** instance

### Run the backend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Markkndr/currency-exchange-platform.git
cd currency-exchange-platform/currency-exchange

./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Configure your database connection and JWT secret via environment variables or `application.properties` before running.

> 🔐 Keep secrets out of version control — use environment variables for credentials and signing keys.
